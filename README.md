MSTU 5003 Design Document

Write a design document where you explain your project. You should clearly explain the problem you're trying to solve. Be sure to describe the domain you're working with and the users you're trying to target. Remember that the point of your design document is that you can hand it off to any developer and theoretically they would be able to understand and build the program.

Topic

This site focuses on game design and development. This site applies to broader fields, mainly computer science education and the gaming industry.

Problem

Entertainment Software Association’s Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry found that 44% of women are game players but only 12% of women make-up the gaming industry. Female game designers still do not have a voice in this mega billion dollar gaming industry. Our society needs more female game designers and developers to create different perspectives and tell different stories. It’s not only the gaming industry that needs to change, it’s all STEM related fields. Only 25% of women who were in the computing workforce in 2015 (NCWIT, By the Numbers), 5% Of African Americans and Latinos make up the Technology workforce in 2015 (Ethnic Diversity in Tech), and 1% of Hispanic women were in the computing workforce in 2015 (NCWIT, By the Numbers).

Game design is the gateway to learning essential 21st century skills like story-telling, collaboration, critical thinking skills, coding, and problem-solving, to only name a few. Research shows that children who play video games are much more likely to want to learn software engineering and computer programming than children who do not (Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2006; Overmars, 2004). This site encourages girls and women to play and create games. Young girls and women have a right to code, design, and create games. This site will be a learning resource for girls and women to learn about game design and development.

Target Audience

My target audience are young girls ages 10 and up. This website is designed to appeal to all girls from all around the world.

That is a very broad audience- any chance you want to start smaller? I feel like it is going to be very hard to carry out. Any ideas how to make it applicable to such a big audience? 


What problem does it solve?Don't forget to specify that.

User Stories

Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.

Structure your user stories as features, so you can actually build it to meet the users needs.

Example: As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Keep these questions in mind:

Who are you building the feature for? What type of user?

What are you building and what will it accomplish?

What kind of engagement and value will the feature/website bring for the user? What does it accomplish?

Strategy

This section should describe objectives, goals and metrics.

Site Objectives:

What do we want to get out of the site?

Success Metrics

Outline how you will check that the goals for your site have been met

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

Definitely add some assessment - luckily game-designer skills are easily measurable.

Pre assessments
Formative assessments
Scope

Functional and Content Specifications

Structure

Interaction design and information architecture

Skeleton

Interface, navigation, information design (You'll provide wireframes here)
comment:I really like the wiaframe of the main page. You ask readers essential questions that help them refine their understanding of what gaming is and who can be a gamer and lead them right into "P.A.C" button, not giving them a chance to get lost or lose interest on their way. It's very a very smart and effective way.
